# MCP Jupyter Edit Server

An MCP server that provides tools for reading and editing Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) in an LLM-friendly format.

This server is meant for working with integrated VSCode Jupyter or dropping in the environment where there is no Jupyter Lab installed. If you prefer using Jupyter Lab consider using this MCP as it has more capabilities: <https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server>

Ofc I've completely vibecoded it.
